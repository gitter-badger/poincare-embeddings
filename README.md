# poincare-embedding

This is a fork of https://github.com/TatsuyaShirakawa/poincare-embedding, which was designed to train word embeddings from WordNet pairs.

This implementation allows training word embeddings on arbitrary text files using the continuous bag-of-words model.

## Build

```shell
cd poincare-embedding
mkdir work & cd work
cmake ..
make
```
